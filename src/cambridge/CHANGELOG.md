If you are running Webform 3.x and intend to upgrade to this version of the Profile we recommend the following steps:

Add Webform 4.x to your sites/all/modules (or wherever your local site modules folder is)
Rebuild the registry so that Webform 4.x is acknowledged as the version being used.
Run updatedb in Drush or update.php in the browser
Disable Webform Conditional in /admin/modules.
Uninstall Webform Conditional in /admin/modules. 
Replace your current version of the Profile with this version (2.1)
Remove Webform from your local modules directory
Rebuild the registry again - this should now have Drupal picking up Webform from the profile again.
